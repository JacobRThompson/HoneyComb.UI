# HoneyComb.UI

A library for making WinForms less awful to work with.

## About
Honeycomb aims to bring .NET's type system into WinForms while mitigating the worst of the behavioral discrepancies and incompatible interfaces shared throughout WinForm's core components. With it, users can:


1. Enforce parsing and validation logic for arbitrary controls via the `IValuedControlHost<TControl, T>` interface

2. Extract user inputs with guaranteed type-safe via the the `IValuedControlHost.TryGetValue()` method
